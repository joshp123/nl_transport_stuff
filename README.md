I want to be able to access public transport data in NL,
to help manage my daily commute and avoid waiting. Here is some code that
will automate this for me.

Current use cases:
- A scheduled notification every morning telling you which metros you can take
  to get to work on time
- An API that can be called from an Apple Watch complication, showing which
  metros are departing in usual directions based on location (i.e. when at home,
  it displays metros towards work, when at work, it displays metros towards home).

This code is hacky and ugly for now, yolo!
